# Veranda2020

Front end website development project with vanilla javascript and no css frameworks. I built everything myself from scratch, including the image slider.

I used a lazy loading technique through an intersection observer API to optimize image loading speed, so the website loads instantly, everytime, and doesnt get bogged down by image loading.

The website is built with a mobile-first design. Upon resizing the screen to less than 650px width, the layout and images via CSS flexbox change to a vertical design, and the image slider and google maps scales down as well to fit in their containers. The top navigation bar also turns into a fixed bar at the bottom of the screen with a hamburger button that displays the navigation options when clicked.
